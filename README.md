Offline
======

**Note to users pre-0.6.0:  Offline previously used a cloudfront hosted file as one of it's methods of detecting the connection status.  This method is now deprecated.  If your app is getting cloudfront 404s, please upgrade to Offline 0.6.0.**

Improve the experience of your app when your users lose connection.

- Monitors ajax requests looking for failure
- Confirms the connection status by requesting an image or fake resource
- Automatically grabs ajax requests made while the connection is down and remakes them
  after the connection is restored.
- Simple UI with beautiful themes
- 3kb minified and compressed

Installing
----------

Include [the javascript](https://github.com/HubSpot/offline/blob/v0.6.0/offline.min.js) and one of [the themes](http://github.hubspot.com/offline/docs/welcome/) on your site.  You're done!

Advanced
--------

Optionally, you can provide some configuration by setting `Offline.options` after
bringing in the script.

Options (any can be provided as a function), with their defaults:

```javascript
{
  // Should we check the connection status immediatly on page load.
  checkOnLoad: false,

  // Should we monitor AJAX requests to help decide if we have a connection.
  interceptRequests: true,

  // Should we automatically retest periodically when the connection is down (set to false to disable).
  reconnect: {
    // How many seconds should we wait before rechecking.
    initialDelay: 3,

    // How long should we wait between retries.
    delay: (1.5 * last delay, capped at 1 hour)
  },

  // Should we store and attempt to remake requests which fail while the connection is down.
  requests: true,

  // Should we show a snake game while the connection is down to keep the user entertained?
  // It's not included in the normal build, you should bring in js/snake.js in addition to
  // offline.min.js.
  game: false
}
```

Properties
----------

`Offline.check()`: Check the current status of the connection.

`Offline.state`: The current state of the connection 'up' or 'down'

`Offline.on(event, handler, context)`: Bind an event.  Events:

  - up: The connection has gone from down to up
  - down: The connection has gone from up to down
  - confirmed-up: A connection test has succeeded, fired even if the connection was already up
  - confirmed-down: A connection test has failed, fired even if the connection was already down
  - checking: We are testing the connection
  - reconnect:started: We are beginning the reconnect process
  - reconnect:stopped: We are done attempting to reconnect
  - reconnect:tick: Fired every second during a reconnect attempt, when a check is not happening
  - reconnect:connecting: We are reconnecting now
  - reconnect:failure: A reconnect check attempt failed
  - requests:flush: Any pending requests have been remade
  - requests:hold: A new request is being held

`Offline.off(event, handler)`: Unbind an event

Checking
--------

Offline ships with two methods for checking the connection.  One makes a request for a tiny image hosted on a
cloudfront account for the benevolence of all, the other makes an XHR request against the current domain,
hoping to get back any sort of response (even a 404).

You can change the url of the image to be one you control, if you like:

```javascript
Offline.options = {checks: {image: {url: 'my-image.gif'}}};
```

Loading an image was chosen (rather than a script file), because it limits the potential damage if a
hostile party were to be in control of it.

You can also switch to the XHR method:

```javascript
Offline.options = {checks: {active: 'xhr'}}
```

The XHR method is not enabled by default because of a concern that some sites do a significant amount of
processing to build their 404 page, so it's not something we want to send unnecessarily.  It's also
possible that the page would respond with a redirect to a different domain, creating a CORS problem.
If you have control of the domain and can create an endpoint which just responds with a quick 204,
that's the perfect solution.  You can set the endpoint in settings as well:

```javascript
Offline.options = {checks: {xhr: {url: '/health-check'}}};
```


Reconnect
---------

The reconnect module automatically retests the connection periodically when it is down.
A successful AJAX request will also trigger a silent recheck (if `interceptRequests` is not false).

You can disable the reconnect module by setting the `reconnect` to false.  Reconnect can be
configured by setting options on the reconnect setting.

Requests
--------

The requests module holds any failed AJAX requests and, after deduping them, remakes them when the connection
is restored.

You can disable it by setting the `requests` setting to false.

Dependencies
------------

None!

Browser Support
